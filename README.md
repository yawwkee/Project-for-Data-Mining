#  Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of lifestyle and physiological factors on sleep quality and duration. Using the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**, I investigated how variables such as **stress levels, occupation, physical activity, and BMI** affect sleep patterns.

The project covers the entire Data Science pipeline: data acquisition, preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and building a Machine Learning model to predict sleep disorders.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset).

* **Rows:** 374
* **Columns:** 13
* **Key Features:** Age, Occupation, Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Heart Rate, Daily Steps, Blood Pressure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Data Analysis & Modeling)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning: Decision Tree Classifier)

## ⚙️ Key Steps & Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing 

* **Blood Pressure:** Split the `Blood Pressure` column (e.g., "126/83") into two numerical columns: `Systolic_BP` and `Diastolic_BP`.
* **BMI Standardization:** Merged duplicate categories ("Normal" and "Normal Weight") into a single category.
* **Missing Values:** Handled `NaN` values in the `Sleep Disorder` column by replacing them with "None" (indicating no disorder).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

I created several visualizations to understand the data relationships:

* **Correlation Matrix:** Revealed a strong negative correlation (**-0.90**) between **Stress Level** and **Quality of Sleep**.
* **Occupation Analysis:** **Sales Representatives** have the shortest average sleep duration (< 6 hours), while **Engineers** sleep the most.
* **BMI Impact:** Confirmed that **Overweight** and **Obese** individuals are significantly more likely to suffer from **Sleep Apnea** and **Insomnia**.

3. Machine Learning Model 

* **Goal:** Predict whether a person has a sleep disorder based on lifestyle factors.
* **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier.
* **Data Split:** 80% Training / 20% Testing.
* **Result:** The model achieved an **Accuracy of 88%** on the test set.

## Key Insights

1. 
**Stress is the biggest enemy of sleep:** High stress levels drastically reduce reported sleep quality.


2. 
**Weight matters:** There is a clear link between high BMI and sleep disorders like Apnea.


3. 
**Career influence:** High-pressure jobs (Sales) correlate with less sleep compared to more stable professions (Engineering).



## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sleep-health-analysis.git

```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

```


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project.ipynb

```
